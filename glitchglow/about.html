<h1>What is Glitch Glow All About?</h1>

<h2>Great Question!</h2>

<p>This company was founded on the idea that perfection isn't beauty. We believed there had to be more to it than that. What a boring world to live in if everything we did was expected to be perfect. Thus the start of this company! We started with creating bright and bold eyeshadows and eyeliners before expanding. Our clients demanded more, so we gave it to them by creating different face and body paints before eventually dropping our hair dye line. We wanted to make Glitch Glow a safe place for people to experiment and get messy with it. We don't place any expectations to be perfect, to have the straightest wing liner or the best blended eyeshadow. If you feel confident in what you created, that's enough for us!</p>

<h2>FAQ:</h2>

<h3><em>Do all products glow in the dark?</em></h3>

<p> No. Not all our products glow, but it will be marked in the description whether or not it does. Some glow in the dark products have to be activated by UV light before working. Please read description before purchasing. </p>

<h3><em>Are your products tested on animals?</em></h3>

<p>No. We are proud to say we do not test on any animals.</p>

<h3><em>Do your products irritate the skin?</em></h3>
<p>Each person is different, some may cause a reaction while others won't. It is best to test this out before use by applying some of the product to the top of your hand and leaving it on a few hours. If irritation happens such as itchiness or swelling, do not use the product.</p>
